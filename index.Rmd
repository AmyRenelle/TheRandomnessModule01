In Ancient Greece, thunderstorms were sometimes thought to be the Gods expressing their anger. Underwater volcanic activity could create pockets of air that would sink pirate ships but be explained as the wrath of the kraken. Elsewhere, earthquakes would sometimes be explained by terrifying monsters causing havok.
Historically, people would attribute more tangible things to random events to help them explain their experiences. Maybe, there are examples of this in your culture? Talk with your peers about possible connections between random phenomenon and folklore, myths, and legends.</p>

*We still have a lot of trouble understanding randomness today. And, while we tend to have a better understanding of the events we experience, there are still many misconceptions around randomness.*
