A long time ago, a Wellington lake (Te Whanganui-a-Tara) was home to two taniwha, Ngake and WhƒÅtaitai. As the years went by, the taniwha outgrew their lake. So, they broke free! With a mighty roar and the crashing of rocks and earth, the taniwha smashed through the cliff, opening their lake out to the ocean (Te Moana o Raukawa - Cook Strait).
<br>
<br>
Nowadays, their lake is called the Wellington Harbour.

This is an example of how a random phenomenon - an earthquake - can become folklore, myths, and legends. We used to have a hard time understanding random events, often blaming God's wrath, sea monsters, or angels.</p>

*We still have a lot of trouble understanding randomness today. And, while we know an earthquake is not caused by mighty taniwha, there are still many misconceptions around randomness.*

This website explores randomness and some key facets that may contribute to randomness misconception. Headphones are recommended for some exercises and pair/group discussions are encouraged.
