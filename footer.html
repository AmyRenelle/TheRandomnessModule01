<p style="font-size:12px; background: #FFF7DD;">This site has been created as part of my PhD thesis on perceptions of randomness. I am always keen for feedback, so please email me any thoughts you have via <a href = "mailto: amy.renelle@auckland.ac.nz">amy.renelle@auckland.ac.nz</a>. Thank you to my supervisors, Dr. Stephanie Budgett and Dr. Rhys Jones, for their guidance throughout my project. I would also like to thank Anna Fergusson for her help inspiring and creating this website. You can find the references for this site <a href = ".\ref1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
