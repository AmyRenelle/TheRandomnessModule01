You would likely come across randomness outside of the statistics classroom when learning about, for example, genetic drift or mutations (biology; Martin & Hine, 2008), radioactivity or lasers (physics; Daintith, 2009), dispersion (geology; Allaby, 2013), and diffusion (chemistry; Daintith, 2008), as well as when conducting research (Gougis et al, 2017). How these subjects consider randomness could contribute to our understanding of the concept. In particular, the use of randomness in subjects other than statistics demonstrates real-world examples where random phenomena may be encountered.

Expanding on lexical ambiguity as a potential source of randomness misconceptions, it is feasible that a lack of consistency between school subjects could also be a potential source of randomness misconceptions.

## 3.3 Biology



## 3.4 Chemistry
<p>Randomness is a key property the universe. As chemistry (m훮tai mat큰) examines the building blocks of the universe, we typically have to deal with this random behaviour. For example, particles are known to move randomly.
<br>
<br>
One example of this is the movement of gas particles through a semi-permeable membrane. The movement from high to low concentration is not a one-step process - the gas particles continually move around, swapping which side of the membrane they are on. The movement from high to low concentration effects the degree of movement; thinking statistically, if there are more particles on one side of the membrane there will be more movement simply because there are more particles to move! </p>
<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="25%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("chem.jpg")
```
</center>

Let's visualise this!

To be able to make this example visible, we will need to make some assumptions. Suppose we can observe 4 gas particles in a vacuum chamber set-up. These particles would be moving quickly and randomly. There would continually be a chance that a particular particle crosses the membrane. But, we would have difficulty visualising this! So, let's assume that we observe the particles during short intervals (2.5 seconds), during which time, each of the particles we are observing have a 50% chance of crossing the membrane.

In the video, we watch the four gas molecules for 25 seconds. During this time, we watch them swap or stay 10 times. Even though the video has some short pauses between each short interval (of 2.5 seconds), this would not be the case in actuality - it is just a consequence of making the video!

<div style="padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/558289736?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="ChemTest1-RM.mp4"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

We should explore the movement more carefully. In particular, remember how I said <em>"if there are more particles on one side of the membrane there will be more movement simply because there are more particles to move"</em>? This is what we will investigate in more detail.

<p>You could do this activity at home or in class using coins and/or a computer.<br>
Collect as many coins (uka) as you can! Let's start off with 10 coins and then add some more. Place 8 coins in one pile on the left and the last 2 coins in another pile of the right.<br>
Flip all of the coins in the pile on the left. Place them into "move" and "stay" groups, where a coin is in the "move" group if it is a head and the "stay" group if it is a tail. These coins represent the gas molecules that "start" on the left side of the chemistry experiment set-up - there is a 50% chance they move to the right side and 50% chance they stay on the left side.</p>
<body>
<ul style="color:gray !important;"><li>How many coins in the left pile moved? How many stayed?</li></ul>
</body>
<p>Do the same with the coins on the right. You should end up with something that looks like this:</p>
<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="25%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("chem01.jpeg")
knitr::include_graphics("chem02.jpeg")
```
</center>

In this example, 62.5% (5/8) moved from the left pile while 50% (2/4) moved from the right pile. After this move, we would have 7 coins in the right pile and 5 coins in the left pile. Relating back to our chemistry example, there was more movement to the side with less molecules!
<br>
<br>
Now, find all the coins you can! Work out what 20% is for how many coins you have found (i.e. I found 40 coins so 20% is 8 coins) and put these in the pile on the right. The rest make a pile on the left. Repeat the steps of flipping the coins and organising them as "move" (heads) or "stay" (tails).

You should end up with something that looks like this. Note, the coins do not hold any value in this example ($2 represents the same as 10c):

<table>
<tr>
<td>Left Pile</td>
<td>Right Pile</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("left.jpeg")
```
</td>
<td>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("right.jpeg")
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

This time, 53.125% (17/32) moved from the left pile while, just by chance, 50% (4/8) moved from the right pile. After this move, we would have 21 coins in the right pile and 19 coins in the left pile. Again, there was more movement to the side with less molecules!
<br>
<br>
Okay, we know there are a lot more gas molecules in our chemistry experiment than what we can represent with coins! So, let's use some code to increase our sample size (n = number of molecules, in this case).

```{r}
#Set the number of molecules in each pile and specify our coin toss outcomes
left = 800
right = 200
coin = c('heads: move', 'tails: stay')

#Randomly sample (i.e., do the coin toss!) for each pile and show the first few outcomes (not all 1000!) along with the overall totals
leftPile = sample(coin, size = left, replace = TRUE); head(leftPile); table(leftPile)
rightPile = sample(coin, size = right, replace = TRUE); head(rightPile); table(rightPile)

#Calculate the new number of molecules on the left and right
newRight = length(which(leftPile == "heads: move")) + length(which(rightPile == "tails: stay")); newRight
newLeft = length(which(leftPile == "tails: stay")) + length(which(rightPile == "heads: move")); newLeft
```

Even if both sides have a move/stay ratio of 50:50, more on one side means the exchange will be greater in one direction than the other (more movement from the larger side).
<br>
<br>
Right, there is one more thing to check out! Often, in chemistry, we think of the movement from high concentration to low concentration across a semi-permeable membrane as being a one-step process. What we see if we run the above simulation 100 times, is a fluctuation around 50%. This fluctuation is more volatile for smaller sample sizes (i.e. few molecules overall). 

<table>
<tr>
<td>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplotn=10c.jpeg")
```
</td>
<td>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplotn=100c.jpeg")
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplotn=1000c.jpeg")
```
</td>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("Rplotn=10000c.jpeg")
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

So, as in the plots, the more molecules (or coins in the simulation), the more stable around 50% either side of the membrane (or in each pile for the simulation). If we have a lot of gas molecules, the balance of 50:50 is often quite quick -- but, that doesn't mean there isn't lots of random movement still! The gas molecules swap sides of the membrane continually and randomly.

<br>

## 3.5 Physics

There are many examples in physics (m훮tai ahup큰ngao) where randomness plays a part. One such example is radioactive decay. Do you recall the waiting time Twitter examples in the Distributions tab? This is similar!

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("atom.jpg")
```
</center>

Radioactive decay, also known as radioactivity, is where an unstable atom (such as uranium) loses energy through radiation. This is a random process but the decay rate is usually known.

The trouble is, while we know the probability of this occurring, it is impossible to predict which atoms will do so! Sounds familiar, right? This fits to the New Zealand mathematics and statistics curriculum definition!

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%", out.extra='style= padding:10px;'}
knitr::include_graphics("phys.jpg")
```
</center>

So, let's say we have 50 atoms we are watching and the rate of decay is 0.167 atoms every hour. 

In the first hour, how many atoms do you expect to decay?
<br>
[8.33 but, we can't have a third of an atom! So, let's say 8 or 9.]{.spoiler}

Now, this is only in theory so let's simulate this!
<br>
<iframe id="interactApp60c310a47285f10017d1398a" width="800" height="800" style="border:none;max-width:100%;margin:0;" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0" src="https://quiz.tryinteract.com/#/60c310a47285f10017d1398a/q/1?method=iframe"></iframe>
<br>
Let's give it a go!
Here are the results of rolling 50 dice. Count how many are a 6.
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
x = "6, 4, 4, 3, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 4, 3, 6, 5, 6, 2, 1, 6, 1, 4, 5, 2, 5, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3"
paste(x, collapse = ", ")
```
There are: [7! So, that means 7 atoms decayed in the first hour.]{.spoiler}
<br>
How many atoms are left? [43!]{.spoiler}
<br>
So, let's roll for the next hour!
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
x = "1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 6"
paste(x, collapse = ", ")
```
<br>
<p>How many atoms decayed this hour? [5!]{.spoiler}</p>
