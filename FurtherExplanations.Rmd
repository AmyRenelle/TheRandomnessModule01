<h2>The Poisson Distribution</h2>
The Poisson distribution provides the *probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time*. This is a discrete distribution - we can't have only half an event occurring! We also cannot have two occurrences of the phenomenon happening at exactly the same time or in exactly the same place.

<h2>The Normal Distribution</h2>
Normal distributions are symmetrical. This means that 50% of values are less than the mean and 50% are greater than the mean. There is more data in the middle of the distribution than in the tails. This is a continuous distribution.

<h2>The Exponential Distribution</h2>
This is related to the Poisson distribution - it is the probability distribution of the *time between events* in a Poisson process. The exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs and is a continuous distribution.

<h2>The Uniform Distribution</h2>
For the uniform distribution, every event is equally likely to occur. Not to be confused with a constant value, which would always produce the same value. The uniform distribution has events with the same probability of occurring. It can be a continuous or discrete distribution.
