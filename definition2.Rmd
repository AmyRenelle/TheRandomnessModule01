There are many definitions of randomness - some good and some less ideal! In the [main module](.\definition1.html), we will be looking at the *no-pattern definition* and the *equiprobability* definition. Here, you will find a few other examples.

As an exercise, we recommend discussing some of the pro's and con's to each of these definitions with your classmates. 

*Which one do you prefer and why?*

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library('knitr')
defs = matrix(data = c(
"Equiprobability Definition", "Randomness is where each observation is equally likely to be selected.", "Batanero et al. (2016)", 
"No-Pattern Definition", "Randomness is where a sequence lacks a discernible pattern.", "Gougis et al. (2017)",
"Subjective Definition", "Randomness is dependent on a person's knowledge.",	"Batanero et al. (2016)",
"Zero-Correlation Definition", "Randomness is where the correlation between pairs of adjacent observations is zero.", "Nickerson (2002)",
"Algorithmic Definition",	"Randomness is where no algorithm can predict future observations of a sequence.", "Batanero et al. (2016)",
"Compressibility Definition", "Randomness is where a sequence cannot be compressed or compacted into a shorter form.", "Chaitin (1975)",
"Predictability Definition I", "Randomness is where the outcome cannot be predicted even though the probability of each observation is fixed.", "New Zealand Ministry of Education (2012)",
"Predictability Definition II",	"Randomness is where it is impossible to predict when an observation will occur", "Bennett (2011)"), nrow = 8, ncol = 3, byrow = T)
